# Movie Recommender SyS _ MovieLens DS

## Overview
The Movie Recommender System is a machine learning project aimed at providing personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and past viewing history. Leveraging collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and matrix factorization techniques, the system generates accurate and relevant movie suggestions tailored to individual user profiles.

## Features
- Collaborative filtering using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm
- Content-based filtering with cosine similarity
- Matrix factorization techniques for dimensionality reduction
- Integration with scikit-learn library for model training and evaluation

## Dataset
The project utilizes the MovieLens dataset, a comprehensive repository of movie ratings contributed by users on the MovieLens platform. The dataset contains over 100,000 ratings, spanning a diverse range of movies and user interactions.

## Model Development
The model development process involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), algorithm selection, and training. Various algorithms, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and matrix factorization, are implemented and fine-tuned to achieve optimal recommendation performance.

## Usage
To use the Movie Recommender System, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main script to train the model and generate movie recommendations.

## Future Scopes
Future enhancements to the Movie Recommender System include:
- Incorporation of deep learning techniques for improved recommendation accuracy.
- Real-time personalization based on user context and behavior.
- Integration with external data sources to enrich user profiles and recommendation quality.
- Designing a user-friendly UI interface with Streamlit for seamless interaction and visualization of recommendations.
- Consideration of implicit feedback and preferences in the recommendation process for better and more accurate results.
